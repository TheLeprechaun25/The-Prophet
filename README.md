The Prophet is a decentralized and automated digital journal. As opposed to conventional journals, The Prophet uses blockchain technology to manage and store scientific papers, incentivize reviewers and reward top authors. Moreover, it uses artificial intelligent systems to automate and lighten the paper revision process.
